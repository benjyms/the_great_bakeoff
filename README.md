Repo created for Project 2

## Datasets
1. json files from https://github.com/apreshill/bakeoff/tree/master/inst/extdata

## The Plan
1. Make this repo and upload raw files
2. Import files into pandas dataframes in a Jupyter Notebook
3. Inspect dfs and decide which variables we are interested in from each table
4. Design ERD to structure data
5. Adjust dfs in Pandas to fit ERD
6. Create tables in PostgreSQL based on ERD
7. Add dfs to SQL tables
8. Update GitHub repo and submit
